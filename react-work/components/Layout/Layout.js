                fascinated with the world of computer science. He \
                shifted his degree towards mechatronics, and on \
                completion with first class honours became free to \
                pledge his full focus toward software development. \
                With Stan able to continue his independent \
                development unhindered he soon was drawn from \
                Adelaide to Sydney to begin his long and inspiring \
                career. One day Stan will return to the world of \
                obotics and automation but for now his main focus \
                is writing elegant snowflakes of code for the \
                powers at be and pursuing the neverending quest for \
                eternal programming knowledge.'
